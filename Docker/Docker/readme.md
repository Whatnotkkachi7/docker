## Overview
***criminalip_docker.py*** is a program that retreives *docker* related assets(e.g. IP, Port, Title, Country) using criminal ip banner search api

## Prerequisites
Go to [criminalip.io](criminalip.io), sign up and get Criminal IP API Key
API Key itself is free and if you have account they automatically assign you one.

## Installation and Setup / Usage
Put the api key value that you got from criminal ip, to the variable ```x-api-key``` in the ```criminalip_docker.py``` file

> [!TIP]
> If you have additional criminal ip search queries that you want to use, you can manually add them by putting them to the ```QUERY_LIST```

## How to get started
Execute the file ```criminalip_docker.py```
